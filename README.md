# Customer Recommendation System 📊🤖

Welcome to the Customer Recommendation System project! This project was developed under the **DEPI (Digital Egypt Pioneer Initiative)** and leverages the power of **Azure Cloud Technology** to deliver personalized recommendations to customers. 🌟

## Project Overview

Our Customer Recommendation System aims to enhance the shopping experience by providing tailored product suggestions based on customer preferences and behavior. This system uses advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand customer needs and recommend the most relevant products.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests products that match individual customer preferences.
- **Azure Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Azure's robust cloud services for data storage, processing, and machine learning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes comprehensive EDA to understand customer behavior and product trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈

EDA is a crucial part of our project. It helps us uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. Here are some of the key insights we gained from our EDA:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified different customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- **Product Trends**: Analyzed which products are most popular among different customer segments.
- **Sales Patterns**: Discovered seasonal trends and peak sales periods.

## Technology Stack

- **Azure Machine Learning**: For building and deploying machine learning models.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**: For storing large volumes of data.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
